### TODO/notes/issues:
'''
2016-11-21 Simen M:
    resize-method in communication is temporarily replaced by the resize function because the arrays are references
        this must be fixed!
    spatial properties to calculate cell/rank from position are given directly in communication.py
        change this to be initialized in main function?
    import comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD from main into communication-module?
    generate initial grid in seperate file/scripts?
    resize XY to fit XY1, now communication is done only one time
        this MUST be done
    only plot active particles
        use active-array in plot to only plot active particles
